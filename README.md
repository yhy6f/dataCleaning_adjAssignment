# Data-cleaning assignment (Feb. 26)

Your task is to write a script that will take [this file](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/assignments/data-cleaning/data/cleanme.csv), perform several cleanup operations on it, and then output a selection of it as a clean CSV. You should be able to acheive all of this using the skills we've learned in class, plus the string methods outlined above. Specifically, you should:

  - Be sure all text fields are represented in uppercase
  - Add leading zeroes to any ZIP codes that are less than 5 digits long (for instance, "2169" should become "02169")
  - Delete any non-breaking spaces (represented as the HTML character "&nbsp;")
  - Save only contributions of $1,000 or more to the output CSV

Once you're done, you should check the results into your Github account, using either a new repository or a single repository dedicated to all of your assignments. The assignment will be due next Friday, March 4.
